## Adding a new service

Services are defined in [src/assets/services.js](/src/assets/services.js).

The icon should be the real logo of the service. If it does not exist in the
[Simple Icons collection](https://icones.js.org/collection/simple-icons),
you may also use the one from [a different collection](https://icones.js.org/collection/all).

If none of the collections contains the original logo of the service,
you should choose an icon which matches the original logo as close as possible.
